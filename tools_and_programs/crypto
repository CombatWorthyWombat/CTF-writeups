  // great online resource for decoding ciphers. requires you to know the encryption method of your ciphertext
  // useful for smaller ciphers like ROT13 and keyboard shifts
  // has a pretty decent RSA solver

  // always use this to see if a given "n" has been solved before
  // great place to start with RSA challenges

quipqiup.com
  // brute force substitution cipher solver
  // useful where you have known plaintext, as it iterates through likley solves
  // includes frequency analysis
