  // great online resource for decoding ciphers. requires you to know the encryption method of your ciphertext
  // useful for smaller ciphers like ROT13 and keyboard shifts
  // has a pretty decent RSA solver

factordb.com
  // always use this to see if a given "n" has been solved before
  // great place to start with RSA challenges
  // API available for code projects

quipqiup.com
  // brute force substitution cipher solver
  // useful where you have known plaintext, as it iterates through likley solves
  // includes frequency analysis

sagemath
  // python module for maths operations useful in cryptography making and breaking
  // from sage.all import *
  // has operations relating to almost all relevant ciphers, eg: class sage.crypto.classical.VigenereCryptosystem(S, n) [where S = a key string, and n = block length]
  // has operations relating to modular arithmetic and factoring, eg: gcd(a,b)

cyberchef
  // has nearly 500 operations that allow you to convert to and from types of data
  // can be used with certificates to encode and decode encryption (including PGP, RSA and a bunch more)
  // more basic operations also available, like hex to decimal
