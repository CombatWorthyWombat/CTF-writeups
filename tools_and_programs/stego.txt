general purpose, and "first impression" steganography tools:

strings
  // linux command that prints readable strings from a given file
  // password protected hidden files often have a plaintext password in strings
  
hexed.it
  // online hexdump and header editor
  // can be used to repair malformed headers so you can work on files further
  
foremost
  // used to recover files using header and footer information. used by the US airforce
  // particularly useful when dealing with damaged jif and png files
  
Exiv2
  // linux metadata extraction tool
  // sometimes challenges can hide information, passwords or hints in plaintext in the metadata

===========================================================================
image steganography tools:

steghide
  // can hide and extract hidden data from files
  // supports the following file formats: JPEG, BMP, WAV, AU
  // linux based, can be gotten from github or using apt
  
zsteg
  // linux tool that detects hidden data in image files
  // supports the following formats: PNG, BMP
  // has "-a" and "-E" commands, that perform all methods of extraction, and extracts to a given location respectivly
  
binwalk
  // linux command that looks for "bins" in a file
  // often finds hidden files and zips contained in stego files
  // can also be used to extract those files, and has a useful recursive option
  
stegsolve
  // tool used to apply colour and other filters to images, as often text in stego is hidden in the image itself
  // you can do this in GIMP or your image editor of your choice, but stegsolve is much faster
  
aperisolve.com
  // online steganography tool
  // does some simple operations that are sometimes all you need for easy challenges
  // runs binwalk, zsteg, steghide, foremost, ExifTool and strings
  
===========================================================================
audio steganography tools:

sonic visualiser
  // while you can use many different audio programs for visualisation, I find this one the best for spectograms
  // sometimes flags/data are hidden in the spectogram
  // often times gives you a good idea of the "shape" of the audio, and if it looks natural or not
  
wavsteg
  // a python3 tool that can extract hidden data from .WAV files
  // when using .MP3 files, you will need to convert to .WAV first (can be done in python)
  // can also be used to hide data in files if you ever need that
  
===========================================================================
crackers:

Fcrackzip
  // kali preinstalled tool that can be used to brute password protected zips (that often turn up in stego challenges)
  // can be used with a defined dictionary, or with a brute algorithm
  
john the ripper
  // another password cracker - more broad in application than Fcrackzip
  // can be used to brute hash collisions
  // also configurable to use either a provided dictionary, or an "incremental" brute algorithm

hashcat
  // best all-round cracker (imo) and comes pre-loaded on kali
  // good optimisations with both CPU and GPU environments, so you will not have issues running it in a VM
  // can utilize precomputed lists and rainbow tables for cracking
  // has a longer max char password limit (55) compared to other tools

===========================================================================
dictionaries:

rockyou
  // password list for use in cracking tools
  
seclists
  // username list for use in cracking tools
