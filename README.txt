a collection of writeups, tools and other various related (hopefully useful) items apropos CTFs

all participated in under the team name VxPx

primarily a learning exercise for myself, and perhaps even for others to learn from

i'll try start from basic knowledge where possible, with that in mind, a CTF is:

  a competition involving various challenges
  the objective of each challenge is to find a "flag"
  the flag is a string of text hidden, obscured or otherwise obfuscated

some classic categories of challenge include:

    crypto - all things encryption and decryption
    OSINT - open source intelligence gathering
    forensics - computer detective work, dealing with logs and other forms of evidence
    net - analysing pcaps to find files, surfaces or a c2
    web - finding and exploiting a web security flaw
    rev - reverse engineering, breaking a game, forcing a state or otherwise fiddling with code

each writeup will contain the category/categories in the filename

with that said, the writeups will contain my thoughts, workflow and eventual solutions to challenges

this will include any mistakes and dead ends I went down

where applicable, credit will be given to others on the VxPx team who put writeups here

many thanks, CombatWorthyWombat
