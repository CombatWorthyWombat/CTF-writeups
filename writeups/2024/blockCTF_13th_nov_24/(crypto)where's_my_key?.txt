we get the following:

a file named "server.py"

and a nc address: nc 54.85.45.101 8001

with the text:

"The flag server is providing encrypted flags.
It looks like there might be a bug in the code and I can't figure out how to decrypt it."

===========================================================================

reading the code a few things jump out:

first is a flag key size line
X25519_KEY_SIZE = 32

googling that seems to suggest this is elliptic curve crypto, with diffie hellman asymmetric key exchange
https://cryptography.io/en/latest/hazmat/primitives/asymmetric/x25519/

it appears to be AES in CTR mode

second is a comment
# This is how you combine dictionaries... right?
response = response and data

so there might be something there to look at - some documentation suggests that their setup is a little off:

(response = response and data) is incorrect. It should be response.update(data) or {**response, **data}.

this exposes the "iv" and "ct" values directly

with these, we can try some predictable keys that might have been used
(usually even predictable keys won't be vulnerable, it's only because the response leaks additional data that we can do this)

python script to:

1: get data from netcat connection
2: generate some random common and simple keys: common_keys = [b'\x00' * 32, b'\x01' * 32, b'flag{' + b'\x00' * 27, b'\xff' * 32]
2: try to decrypt using (ct, iv, key)

success! the key was particularly bad, just threw a couple guesses in there and it worked. could have iterated through some more keys if they didn't work
