we are given the following:
a file titled: "steg_09.mov"
the companion text includes:
"this is a video clip" and it "has two mysterious demonic voices in it"
the language is supposedly "Sumerian, Mayan, Hittite, Aramaic, Ugaritic, and Akkadian" or even "Nephilim"
"The skeptics among us have suggested that the voices are the result of some advanced, unknown version of steganography"
===========================================================================
first impressions:

the file is a video clip of an abandoned hallway with a sunlit chair in the middle - almost like an interrogation setup

appears to be a song with the name and band at the bottom of the image:
behind the mask - by dirtyprotest

at about 1:50 a voices can be heard, it sounds reversed?

a second voice can be heard later, it sounds down-pitched and altered in some way

try .mov -> .mp3 and reverse the .mp3 file
the first voice is intelligible now

tells us the flag is the name of a 70s band that wrote "fly like an eagle"
flag{steve_miller_band}

the other voice will probably be used in a further challenge
