we are given the following:
a file titled: "STEG05-1.csv"
and a little bit of text:

"DEADFACE has been hacking random people all over town and no one can seem to figure out what they are doing.
All we know at this time is that the most recent site that was hit was Otto’s Grocery Store.
Oddly, only the customers are being affected and not the company’s network. What is happening?
They hired our firm to sniff out the attack and we successfully captured a strange file being sent
across the guest WiFi. We believe this is the primary attack vector,
and we’ve heard some victims mention that they had to “scan” something - maybe it is in the wrong format?
Can you figure out how this file is being used in the attack to reveal the flag?"
===========================================================================
first impressions

whats a .csv file? apparently used by spreadsheets

as people are being asked to "scan" things, maybe looking for a barcode
===========================================================================
opening the file in a spreadsheet application:
smallish spreadsheet with some cells containing a '0' and others '255'
'255' is the max value for rgb colour? maybe shade in the cells

-> once we do that, we can see a QR code taking shape, resize columns and rows to make it square

scanning the code gives us the flag:

flag{that_will_be_five_dollars}
