connection: ssh level1@io.netgarage.org
password: level1

just looking around...

there is a wallet.dat file,
cat wallet.dat -> srsly (xD)

using cat on level01 in the /levels directory:

-> okay looks like an ELF file (from the headder) how do I extract this and look at it as a binary?
-> some strings jump out:
    
    Enter the 3 digit passcode to enter:
    Congrats you found it, now read the password for level2 from /home/level2/.pass

tried using scp -> no luck
looked up a bunch online but can't seem to find anything
joined the IRC channel and asked there (this is basic no?)

using:
scp level1@io:/levels/level01 /home/user/Documents/IO-netgarage

gets me somewhere - it asks for a password, but then it yields:
/home/user/Documents/IO-netgarage: No such file or directory

using:
readlink -f README.txt ->
/home/user/Documents/IO-netgarage/README.txt

thats the same one i used already...

try in new terminal:
scp level1@io.netgarage.org:/levels/level01 /home/user/Documents/IO-netgarage

I think that worked? -> nice it did something! (note: use scp when NOT already in the ssh connection)

chmod +x level01
./level01

-> Enter the three digit passcode to enter:
-> aaa
-> exit

lets open in ghidra:

decompiler pictured in level01.png

the puts(&prompt1): -> is the "Enter the three digit passcode to enter:"

  iVar2 = fscanf(__stream,param_2);
  if (iVar2 != 0x10f) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    exit((int)__stream);

looks like if the param_2 (the user password) is not (0x10f, or 271 in dec) -> failiure condition

try 271:
-> Enter the three digit passcode to enter:
-> 271
-> Congrats you found it, now read the password for level2 from /home/level2/.pass

hmm lets look for that on the ssh:

trying to cat /home/level2/.pass
-> Permission denied
hmm - i can get into the level2 directory, but everything is denied permission

maybe try running the file in the ssh server:
aha! that works, after the stuff we saw earlier, we get the following:

sh-4.3$ -> which i think is a user with level2 permissions, so i can just cat /home/levels/level2/.pass directly
