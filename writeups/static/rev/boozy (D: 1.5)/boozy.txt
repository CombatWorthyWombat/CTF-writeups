we are given an executable and the following blurb:

"This a way how GTA5 generates hash values for vehicles :)"

the file was called "keyGen" -> so looking for some sort of keygen function

======================================

checking out the compiler, the main function asks for a username (see boozy_main.png)
-> then checks it
-> then asks for a password
-> then checks it

we have to satisfy the condition: 'password = user_int_input' (after renaming)

the password is determined by a custom hash function run on the username the user submits
-> called "boozhash"
-> as seen in boozhash.png

initialises an "x" to = 0

while *arg_1 != 0 (ie, for each character of the null terminated string)

    -> lower_char = tolower(*arg_1)
        -> takes the lowercase for the char pointed to at arg_1

    -> x = (x + lower_char) * 0x401
        -> new_x = (x + lower_char) * 1025

    -> x = x ^ x >> 6
        -> new_x = x XOR (x right bitshifted 6)

    -> arg_1 = arg_1 + 1
        -> increments the pointer to point at the next character in the string

once it's done all that, the return function is:
-> (x * 9 ^ x * 9 >> 0xb) * 0x8001
    -> (9x XOR 9x >> 11) * 32769 = return value

lets see if i can remake the function in python, so i can predict what a boozhash output might be for a given username
for the username: "username" we get the hash: 1262930344147387910852449154 (see boozhash.py)

running the .exe using bottles/wine
