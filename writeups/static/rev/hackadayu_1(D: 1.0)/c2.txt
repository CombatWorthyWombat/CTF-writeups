c2 challenge

replace the main function signature with the C standard to clean up the compiled psuedo-code

some pieces of code that seem important:
-> if (password_len  < 5)
-> else if ((argv*[1][0] == 'h') && (argv[1][4] == "u"))
    -> first character is "h" and the fifth is "u"

so a password that fulfills these criteria would be:
h???u

try supplying to the file:
-> ./c2 h???u

we get:
-> Correct -- maybe we should pay attention to more characters...

see c2.png for renamed pseudo-code
