edit the main function signature to match the C standard
rename variables for ease of understanding

we have two logic checks for the password:

-> if (password_len < 10) {

and

-> for (counter = 0; counter < (int)password_len; counter = counter + 1) {
     -> if ("hackaday-u"[counter] + 2 != (int)argv[1][counter]) {
         -> puts("Wrong Password!");

the first checks if the supplied password is smaller than 10, and returns a fail condition if it is

the second also returns a fail condition, if each character of the password doesn't match:
-> "hackaday-u" + 2

python script to create the value above (as seen in c4.py)
jcemcfc{/w

-> ./c4 jcemcfc{/w
-> Correct! You've entered the right password ... you're getting better at this!
