c3

trying to open returns:
-> Permission denied

try opening in ghidra
edit the function signature to C main standard

the password (as before) needs to be of len > 5
plus an additional piece of logic:

-> else if ((uint)(byte)argv[1][2] - (uint)(byte)argv[1][3] == 0x20) {

    -> if (password[2] - password[3] == 32

so we need to find two characters that are 32 'apart'
UTF-8 for "0" is 0x30 (48 in dec)
UTF-8 for (48 + 32) is 0x50 or "P"

so lets try:
./c3 ??0P?

bash: ./c3: Permission denied

hmm okay, something i did isn't quite right
oh i need to chmod +x the file...

-> IncorRect pasSword!

okay thats at least better, lets see what causes that exception:
its the comparison for the 3rd and 4th character logic

z = 122
Z = 90

so lets try that pair:
./c3 ??zZ?

-> Correct! You figured it out ... looks like we have to upgrade our security...
