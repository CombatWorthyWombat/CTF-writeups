we are given the following:
a file titled: "devil.jpg"
and a little bit of text:

"In the depths of the Pine Barrens, a cryptic legend whispers of the Jersey Devil guarding a picture.
Tales speak of forgotten knowledge sealed within, but only those sharp enough to see the truth can unlock its secrets.
The key? The key hiding in plain sight, woven into the eerie folklore itself,
waiting for the chosen few to discover and reveal the dark treasures within."
===========================================================================

first impressions:

"forgotten knowledge sealed within" suggests a hidden file in the .jpg

"the key is hiding in plain sight" suggests we might need a key for the hidden file, and they key is hidden in the image
