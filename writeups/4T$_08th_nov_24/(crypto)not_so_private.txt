chall named Not_So_Private -> probably to do with the private key

looks like normal RSA keygen of 4096

public exponent is standard at  = 65537

n has a wierd generation, its a random 4096bit prime times 2

n = 2*p

so essentially the two primes are:

p = random4096
q = 2

pop into dcode -> 328472458544618590289570918928223643737038607188808646290557

decimal -> hex -> ascii -> 4T${one_to_rule_them_all}
